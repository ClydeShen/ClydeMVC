# ClydeMVC

ClydeMVC is an Application Development Framework for people who build web sites using PHP in MVC (Model-View-Controller)structure.Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch.

# Model-View-Controller

ClydeMVC is based on the Model-View-Controller development pattern. MVC is a software approach that separates application logic from presentation. In practice, it permits your web pages to contain minimal scripting since the presentation is separate from the PHP scripting.

- The **Model** represents your data structures. Typically your model classes will contain functions that help you retrieve, insert, and update information in your database.
- The **View** is the information that is being presented to a user. A View will normally be a web page, but in ClydeMVC, a view can also be a page fragment like a header or footer.
- The **Controller** serves as an intermediary between the Model, the View, and any other resources needed to process the HTTP request and generate a web page.
